This is new code that will have to be added during a rebase

Added a new line fromn local command line
New Line from GitHub. This will cause a merge conflic
Yet another new line that will clash and cause a conflic
lined added to be pulled rather than fetched
A new Command line line will clash 
This will cause a fuss
and clash 
and clash
New line is out of sync with command line file.
I didn't notice the last line maerge
Maybe a clash only happens if the two lines are in the same place
A new line in a file that is far small on the remote
