This is the first new file that has been added using VS with the test Hello-world project

I have added additional lines so that they can be modified and removed. They initally went from line 1 to line4

line1 This is the first line of the test file

line2 Second line using numbers to make it easier to follow any changes that have been made

line3 After the line 1 and 2 line3 seamed to be the obvious choice

line4 line 4 is the last created in the inital creation of the Hello-world_FileOne file 

Line5 Line 5 was added to the Hello-world_FileOne file from branch 2. so shouldn't be in branch 1 until it is somehow called into it

Line 6 has now been added in VS. Will try to push and create PR so it goes to the remote server
